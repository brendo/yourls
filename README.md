## YOURLS

A Symphony extension that integrates with [YOURLS](http://yourls.org/)

### Installation

1. Upload the `yourls` folder to your Symphony `/extensions` folder.
2. Enable it by selecting the "YOURLS", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.
3. Add your domain and signature values to your Preferences
4. You can now add the "YOURLS" field to your sections.

### Usage

#### Developer

The goal is to create a Symphony page that best represents your content as a permalink. The classic example of this is a blog with articles. The permalink structure might be `/article/135/`.

1. Create a page to showcase the entry. eg. `/article/:entry_id/`
2. Adds the `YOURLS` field to your desired section, and enters the path of the previous page, eg `/article/`. Optionally configures if custom short slugs can be entered.
3. Creates a datasource for the section that filters on a single parameter, `entry_id`. This datasource should be attached to the page described in 1 (along with any others that are required)


#### Author

1. Opens the section and creates a new Entry
2. If the field allows custom slugs, an input field is shown asking the author for the custom slug.
3. Author enters custom slug, or leaves it empty (autogenerated) and hits Create Entry
4. A new shortlink is created in YOURLS which references the URL structure set in the field, eg. `http://example.com/article/135`
